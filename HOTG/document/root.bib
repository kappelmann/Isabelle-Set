abstract="We report on a formalization of ordinals and cardinals in Isabelle/HOL. A main challenge we faced is the inability of higher-order logic to represent ordinals canonically, as transitive sets (as done in set theory). We resolved this into a ``decentralized'' representation that identifies ordinals with wellorders, with all concepts and results proved to be invariant under order isomorphism. We also discuss two applications of this general theory in formal developments.",
